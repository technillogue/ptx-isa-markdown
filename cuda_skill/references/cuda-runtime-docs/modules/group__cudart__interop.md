### Functions

__host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphicsMapResources ( int  count, cudaGraphicsResource_t* resources, cudaStream_t stream = 0 )


Map graphics resources for access by CUDA.

######  Parameters

`count`
    \- Number of resources to map
`resources`
    \- Resources to map for CUDA
`stream`
    \- Stream for synchronization

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Maps the `count` graphics resources in `resources` for access by CUDA.

The resources in `resources` may be accessed by CUDA until they are unmapped. The graphics API from which `resources` were registered should not access any resources while they are mapped by CUDA. If an application does so, the results are undefined.

This function provides the synchronization guarantee that any graphics calls issued before cudaGraphicsMapResources() will complete before any subsequent CUDA work issued in `stream` begins.

If `resources` contains any duplicate entries then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If any of `resources` are presently mapped for access by CUDA then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

  * This function uses standard default stream semantics.

__host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphicsResourceGetMappedMipmappedArray ( cudaMipmappedArray_t* mipmappedArray, cudaGraphicsResource_t resource )


Get a mipmapped array through which to access a mapped graphics resource.

######  Parameters

`mipmappedArray`
    \- Returned mipmapped array through which `resource` may be accessed
`resource`
    \- Mapped resource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Returns in `*mipmappedArray` a mipmapped array through which the mapped graphics resource `resource` may be accessed. The value set in `mipmappedArray` may change every time that `resource` is mapped.

If `resource` is not a texture then it cannot be accessed via an array and cudaErrorUnknown is returned. If `resource` is not mapped then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

__host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphicsResourceGetMappedPointer ( void** devPtr, size_t* size, cudaGraphicsResource_t resource )


Get an device pointer through which to access a mapped graphics resource.

######  Parameters

`devPtr`
    \- Returned pointer through which `resource` may be accessed
`size`
    \- Returned size of the buffer accessible starting at `*devPtr`
`resource`
    \- Mapped resource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Returns in `*devPtr` a pointer through which the mapped graphics resource `resource` may be accessed. Returns in `*size` the size of the memory in bytes which may be accessed from that pointer. The value set in `devPtr` may change every time that `resource` is mapped.

If `resource` is not a buffer then it cannot be accessed via a pointer and cudaErrorUnknown is returned. If `resource` is not mapped then cudaErrorUnknown is returned. *

__host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphicsResourceSetMapFlags ( cudaGraphicsResource_t resource, unsigned int  flags )


Set usage flags for mapping a graphics resource.

######  Parameters

`resource`
    \- Registered resource to set flags for
`flags`
    \- Parameters for resource mapping

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Set `flags` for mapping the graphics resource `resource`.

Changes to `flags` will take effect the next time `resource` is mapped. The `flags` argument may be any of the following:

  * cudaGraphicsMapFlagsNone: Specifies no hints about how `resource` will be used. It is therefore assumed that CUDA may read from or write to `resource`.

  * cudaGraphicsMapFlagsReadOnly: Specifies that CUDA will not write to `resource`.

  * cudaGraphicsMapFlagsWriteDiscard: Specifies CUDA will not read from `resource` and will write over the entire contents of `resource`, so none of the data previously stored in `resource` will be preserved.


If `resource` is presently mapped for access by CUDA then cudaErrorUnknown is returned. If `flags` is not one of the above values then cudaErrorInvalidValue is returned.

__host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphicsSubResourceGetMappedArray ( cudaArray_t* array, cudaGraphicsResource_t resource, unsigned int  arrayIndex, unsigned int  mipLevel )


Get an array through which to access a subresource of a mapped graphics resource.

######  Parameters

`array`
    \- Returned array through which a subresource of `resource` may be accessed
`resource`
    \- Mapped resource to access
`arrayIndex`
    \- Array index for array textures or cubemap face index as defined by cudaGraphicsCubeFace for cubemap textures for the subresource to access
`mipLevel`
    \- Mipmap level for the subresource to access

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidValue, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Returns in `*array` an array through which the subresource of the mapped graphics resource `resource` which corresponds to array index `arrayIndex` and mipmap level `mipLevel` may be accessed. The value set in `array` may change every time that `resource` is mapped.

If `resource` is not a texture then it cannot be accessed via an array and cudaErrorUnknown is returned. If `arrayIndex` is not a valid array index for `resource` then cudaErrorInvalidValue is returned. If `mipLevel` is not a valid mipmap level for `resource` then cudaErrorInvalidValue is returned. If `resource` is not mapped then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

__host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphicsUnmapResources ( int  count, cudaGraphicsResource_t* resources, cudaStream_t stream = 0 )


Unmap graphics resources.

######  Parameters

`count`
    \- Number of resources to unmap
`resources`
    \- Resources to unmap
`stream`
    \- Stream for synchronization

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Unmaps the `count` graphics resources in `resources`.

Once unmapped, the resources in `resources` may not be accessed by CUDA until they are mapped again.

This function provides the synchronization guarantee that any CUDA work issued in `stream` before cudaGraphicsUnmapResources() will complete before any subsequently issued graphics work begins.

If `resources` contains any duplicate entries then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned. If any of `resources` are not presently mapped for access by CUDA then cudaErrorUnknown is returned.

  * This function uses standard default stream semantics.

__host__ cudaError_t cudaGraphicsUnregisterResource ( cudaGraphicsResource_t resource )


Unregisters a graphics resource for access by CUDA.

######  Parameters

`resource`
    \- Resource to unregister

###### Returns

cudaSuccess, cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle, cudaErrorUnknown

###### Description

Unregisters the graphics resource `resource` so it is not accessible by CUDA unless registered again.

If `resource` is invalid then cudaErrorInvalidResourceHandle is returned.

  * Use of the handle after this call is undefined behavior.

### 6.4.4. Labels and Function Names as Operands


Labels and function names can be used only in `bra`/`brx.idx` and `call` instructions respectively. Function names can be used in `mov` instruction to get the address of the function into a register, for use in an indirect call.

Beginning in PTX ISA version 3.1, the `mov` instruction may be used to take the address of kernel functions, to be passed to a system call that initiates a kernel launch from the GPU. This feature is part of the support for CUDA Dynamic Parallelism. See the _CUDA Dynamic Parallelism Programming Guide_ for details.

### 6.4.2. Arrays as Operands


Arrays of all types can be declared, and the identifier becomes an address constant in the space where the array is declared. The size of the array is a constant in the program.

Array elements can be accessed using an explicitly calculated byte address, or by indexing into the array using square-bracket notation. The expression within square brackets is either a constant integer, a register variable, or a simple _register with constant offset_ expression, where the offset is a constant expression that is either added or subtracted from a register variable. If more complicated indexing is desired, it must be written as an address calculation prior to use. Examples are:

ld.global.u32  s, a[0];
    ld.global.u32  s, a[N-1];
    mov.u32        s, a[1];  // move address of a[1] into s

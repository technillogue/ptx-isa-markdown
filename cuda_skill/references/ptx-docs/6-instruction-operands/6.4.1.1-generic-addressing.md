#### 6.4.1.1. Generic Addressing


If a memory instruction does not specify a state space, the operation is performed using generic addressing. The state spaces `.const`, [Kernel Function Parameters](<#kernel-function-parameters>) (`.param`), `.local` and `.shared` are modeled as windows within the generic address space. Each window is defined by a window base and a window size that is equal to the size of the corresponding state space. A generic address maps to `global` memory unless it falls within the window for `const`, `local`, or `shared` memory. The [Kernel Function Parameters](<#kernel-function-parameters>) (`.param`) window is contained within the `.global` window. Within each window, a generic address maps to an address in the underlying state space by subtracting the window base from the generic address.

## 3.3. On-chip Shared Memory


As illustrated by [Figure 4](<#set-of-simt-multiprocessors-hardware-model>), each multiprocessor has on-chip memory of the four following types:

* One set of local 32-bit _registers_ per processor,

  * A parallel data cache or _shared memory_ that is shared by all scalar processor cores and is where the shared memory space resides,

  * A read-only _constant cache_ that is shared by all scalar processor cores and speeds up reads from the constant memory space, which is a read-only region of device memory,

  * A read-only _texture cache_ that is shared by all scalar processor cores and speeds up reads from the texture memory space, which is a read-only region of device memory; each multiprocessor accesses the texture cache via a _texture unit_ that implements the various addressing modes and data filtering.

The local and global memory spaces are read-write regions of device memory.

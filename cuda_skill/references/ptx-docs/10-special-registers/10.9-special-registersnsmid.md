## 10.9. Special Registers:%nsmid


`%nsmid`

Number of SM identifiers.

Syntax (predefined)

.sreg .u32 %nsmid;

Description

A predefined, read-only special register that returns the maximum number of SM identifiers. The SM identifier numbering is not guaranteed to be contiguous, so `%nsmid` may be larger than the physical number of SMs in the device.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

Target ISA Notes

`%nsmid` requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

mov.u32  %r, %nsmid;

## 13.27. Changes in PTX ISA Version 5.0


New Features

PTX ISA version 5.0 introduces the following new features:

* Support for `sm_60`, `sm_61`, `sm_62` target architecture.

  * Extends atomic and reduction instructions to perform double-precision add operation.

  * Extends atomic and reduction instructions to specify `scope` modifier.

  * A new `.common` directive to permit linking multiple object files containing declarations of the same symbol with different size.

  * A new `dp4a` instruction which allows 4-way dot product with accumulate operation.

  * A new `dp2a` instruction which allows 2-way dot product with accumulate operation.

  * Support for special register `%clock_hi`.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

Semantics of cache modifiers on `ld` and `st` instructions were clarified to reflect cache operations are treated as performance hint only and do not change memory consistency behavior of the program.

Semantics of `volatile` operations on `ld` and `st` instructions were clarified to reflect how `volatile` operations are handled by optimizing compiler.

* A new `lop3` instruction which allows arbitrary logical operation on 3 inputs.

  * Adds support for 64-bit computations in extended precision arithmetic instructions.

  * Extends `tex.grad` instruction to support `cube` and `acube` geometries.

  * Extends `tld4` instruction to support `a2d`, `cube` and `acube` geometries.

  * Extends `tex` and `tld4` instructions to support optional operands for offset vector and depth compare.

  * Extends `txq` instruction to support querying texture fields from specific LOD.

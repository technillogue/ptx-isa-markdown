### 8.11.1. Reductions do not form Acquire Patterns


Atomic reduction operations like `red` do not form acquire patterns with acquire fences.

**Litmus Test: Message Passing with a Red Instruction**

.global .u32 x = 0;
    .global .u32 flag = 0;
      
  
---  
T1 | T2  
      
    
    W1: st.u32 [x], 42;
    W2: st.release.gpu.u32 [flag], 1;
    

| 
    
    
    RMW1: red.sys.global.add.u32 [flag], 1;
    F2: fence.acquire.gpu;
    R2: ld.weak.u32 %r1, [x];
      
      
    
    %r1 == 0 AND flag == 2

The litmus test known as “MP” (Message Passing) demonstrates the consequence of reductions being excluded from acquire patterns. It is possible to observe the outcome where `R2` reads the value `0` from `x` and `flag` has the final value of `2`. This outcome is possible since the release pattern in `T1` does not synchronize with any acquire pattern in `T2`. Using the `atom` instruction instead of `red` forbids this outcome.

### 8.9.2. Observation Order


_Observation order_ relates a write W to a read R through an optional sequence of atomic read-modify-write operations.

A write W precedes a read R in _observation order_ if:

1. R and W are _morally strong_ and R reads the value written by W, or

  2. For some atomic operation Z, W precedes Z and Z precedes R in _observation order_.

## 8.6. Proxies


A _memory proxy_ , or a _proxy_ is an abstract label applied to a method of memory access. When two memory operations use distinct methods of memory access, they are said to be different _proxies_.

Memory operations as defined in [Operation types](<#operation-types>) use _generic_ method of memory access, i.e. a _generic proxy_. Other operations such as textures and surfaces all use distinct methods of memory access, also distinct from the _generic_ method.

A _proxy fence_ is required to synchronize memory operations across different _proxies_. Although virtual aliases use the _generic_ method of memory access, since using distinct virtual addresses behaves as if using different _proxies_ , they require a _proxy fence_ to establish memory ordering.

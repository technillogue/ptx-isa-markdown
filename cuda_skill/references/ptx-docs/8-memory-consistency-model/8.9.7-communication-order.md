### 8.9.7. Communication Order


The _communication order_ is a non-transitive order, determined at runtime, that relates write operations to other _overlapping_ memory operations.

1. A write W precedes an _overlapping_ read R in _communication order_ if R returns the value of any byte that was written by W.

  2. A write W precedes a write W’ in _communication order_ if W precedes W’ in _coherence order_.

  3. A read R precedes an _overlapping_ write W in _communication order_ if, for any byte accessed by both R and W, R returns the value written by a write W’ that precedes W in _coherence order_.

_Communication order_ captures the visibility of memory operations — when a memory operation X1 precedes a memory operation X2 in _communication order_ , X1 is said to be visible to X2.

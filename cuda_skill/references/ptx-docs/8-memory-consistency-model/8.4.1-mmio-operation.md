### 8.4.1. mmio Operation


An _mmio_ operation is a memory operation with `.mmio` qualifier specified. It is usually performed on a memory location which is mapped to the control registers of peer I/O devices. It can also be used for communication between threads but has poor performance relative to non-_mmio_ operations.

The semantic meaning of _mmio_ operations cannot be defined precisely as it is defined by the underlying I/O device. For formal specification of semantics of _mmio_ operation from Memory Consistency Model perspective, it is equivalent to the semantics of a _strong_ operation. But it follows a few implementation-specific properties, if it meets the _CUDA atomicity requirements_ at the specified scope:

* Writes are always performed and are never combined within the scope specified.

  * Reads are always performed, and are not forwarded, prefetched, combined, or allowed to hit any cache within the scope specified.

    * As an exception, in some implementations, the surrounding locations may also be loaded. In such cases the amount of data loaded is implementation specific and varies between 32 and 128 bytes in size.

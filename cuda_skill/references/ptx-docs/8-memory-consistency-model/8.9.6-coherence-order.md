### 8.9.6. Coherence Order


There exists a partial transitive order that relates _overlapping_ write operations, determined at runtime, called the _coherence order_ 1. Two _overlapping_ write operations are related in _coherence order_ if they are _morally strong_ or if they are related in _causality order_. Two _overlapping_ writes are unrelated in _coherence order_ if they are in a _data-race_ , which gives rise to the partial nature of _coherence order_.

1 _Coherence order_ cannot be observed directly since it consists entirely of write operations. It may be observed indirectly by its use in constraining the set of candidate writes that a read operation may read from.

### 8.2.6. Initialization


Each byte in memory is initialized by a hypothetical write _W0_ executed before starting any thread in the program. If the byte is included in a program variable, and that variable has an initial value, then _W0_ writes the corresponding initial value for that byte; else _W0_ is assumed to have written an unknown but constant value to the byte.

### 8.2.5. Memory Operations on Packed Data Types


A packed data type consists of two values of the same scalar data type, as described in [Packed Data Types](<#packed-data-types>). These values are accessed in adjacent memory locations. A memory operation on a packed data type is modelled as a pair of equivalent memory operations on the scalar data type, executed in an unspecified order on each element of the packed data.

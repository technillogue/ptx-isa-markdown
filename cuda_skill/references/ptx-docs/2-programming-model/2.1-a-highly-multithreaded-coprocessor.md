## 2.1. A Highly Multithreaded Coprocessor


The GPU is a compute device capable of executing a very large number of threads in parallel. It operates as a coprocessor to the main CPU, or host: In other words, data-parallel, compute-intensive portions of applications running on the host are off-loaded onto the device.

More precisely, a portion of an application that is executed many times, but independently on different data, can be isolated into a kernel function that is executed on the GPU as many different threads. To that effect, such a function is compiled to the PTX instruction set and the resulting kernel is translated at install time to the target GPU instruction set.

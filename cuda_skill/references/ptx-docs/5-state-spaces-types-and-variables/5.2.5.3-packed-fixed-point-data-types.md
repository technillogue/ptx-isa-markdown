#### 5.2.5.3. Packed Fixed-Point Data Types


PTX supports `.s2f6x2` packed fixed-point data type consisting of two `.s2f6` packed fixed-point values. A register variable containing `.s2f6x2` value must be declared with `.b16` type. Packed fixed-point data type cannot be used as fundamental type and is only supported as instruction type.

### 5.5.2. Tensor Access Modes


Tensor data can be accessed in two modes:

* Tiled mode:  
  
In tiled mode, the source multi-dimensional tensor layout is preserved at the destination.

  * Im2col mode:

In im2col mode, the elements in the Bounding Box of the source tensor are rearranged into columns at the destination. Refer [here](<https://in.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/im2col.html>) for more details.

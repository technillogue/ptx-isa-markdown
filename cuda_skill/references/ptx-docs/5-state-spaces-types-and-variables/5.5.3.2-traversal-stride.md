#### 5.5.3.2. Traversal-Stride


While the Bounding Box is iterating the tensor across a dimension, the traversal stride specifies the exact number of elements to be skipped. If no jump over is required, default value of 1 must be specified.

The traversal stride in dimension 0 can be used for the [Interleave layout](<#tensor-interleaved-layout>). For non-interleaved layout, the traversal stride in dimension 0 must always be 1.

[Figure 8](<#tensor-tiled-mode-bb-example>) illustrates tensor, tensor size, tensor stride, Bounding Box size and traversal stride.

#### 5.5.3.1. Bounding Box


A tensor can be accessed in chunks known as _Bounding Box_. The Bounding Box has the same dimensionality as the tensor they are accessing into. Size of each bounding Box must be a multiple of 16 bytes. The address of the bounding Box must also be aligned to 16 bytes.

Bounding Box has the following access properties:

* Bounding Box dimension sizes

  * Out of boundary access mode

  * Traversal strides

The tensor-coordinates, specified in the PTX tensor instructions, specify the starting offset of the bounding box. Starting offset of the bounding box along with the rest of the bounding box information together are used to determine the elements which are to be accessed.

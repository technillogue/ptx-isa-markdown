#### 5.2.5.2. Packed Integer Data Types


PTX supports two variants of packed integer data types: `.u16x2` and `.s16x2`. The packed data type consists of two `.u16` or `.s16` values. A register variable containing `.u16x2` or `.s16x2` data must be declared with `.b32` type. Packed integer data types cannot be used as fundamental types. They are supported as instruction types on certain instructions.

#### 5.5.5.4. wOffset


In the convolution calculations, the same elements along the `W` dimension are reused for different locations within the convolution filter footprint. Based on the number of times a pixel is used, the pixels may be loaded into different shared memory buffers. Each buffer can be loaded by a separate tensor copy operation.

The `wOffset` argument in the tensor copy and prefetch instruction adjusts the source pixel location for each buffer. The exact position of the buffer is adjusted along the `W` dimension using the following formula:

Bounding Box Lower Corner W += wOffset
    Bounding Box Upper Corner W += wOffset
    W += wOffset

Following are examples of tensor copy to multiple buffers with various `wHalo` and `wOffset` values:

Example 1:

Tensor Size [0] = 128
    Tensor Size [1] = 9
    Tensor Size [2] = 67
    Tensor Size [3] = 64
    Pixels-per-Column = 128
    Channels-per-pixel = 64
    Bounding Box Lower Corner W = -1
    Bounding Box Upper Corner W = 0
    Traversal Stride = 2
    
    Tensor Coordinates in the instruction = (7, 2, -1, 0)
    
    Shared memory buffer 1:
       wHalo = 1
       wOffset = 0
    
    Shared memory buffer 2:
       wHalo = 0
       wOffset = 1

Example 2:

Tensor Size [0] = 128
    Tensor Size [1] = 7
    Tensor Size [2] = 7
    Tensor Size [3] = 64
    Pixels-per-Column = 128
    Channels-per-pixel = 64
    Bounding Box Lower Corner W = -1
    Bounding Box Upper Corner W = -1
    Traversal Stride = 3
    
    Tensor Coordinates in the instruction = (7, 2, -1, 0)
    
    Shared memory buffer 1:
       wHalo = 0
       wOffset = 0
    
    Shared memory buffer 2:
       wHalo = 0
       wOffset = 1
    
    Shared memory buffer 3:
       wHalo = 0
       wOffset = 2

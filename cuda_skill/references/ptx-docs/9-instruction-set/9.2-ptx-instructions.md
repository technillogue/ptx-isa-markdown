## 9.2. PTX Instructions


PTX instructions generally have from zero to four operands, plus an optional guard predicate appearing after an `@` symbol to the left of the `opcode`:

* `@p opcode;`  
  
  * `@p opcode a;`

  * `@p opcode d, a;`

  * `@p opcode d, a, b;`

  * `@p opcode d, a, b, c;`

For instructions that create a result value, the `d` operand is the destination operand, while `a`, `b`, and `c` are source operands.

The `setp` instruction writes two destination registers. We use a `|` symbol to separate multiple destination registers.

setp.lt.s32  p|q, a, b;  // p = (a < b); q = !(a < b);

For some instructions the destination operand is optional. A _bit bucket_ operand denoted with an underscore (`_`) may be used in place of a destination register.

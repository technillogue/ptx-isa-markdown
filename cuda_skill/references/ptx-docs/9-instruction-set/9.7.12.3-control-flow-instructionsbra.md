#### 9.7.12.3. Control Flow Instructions:bra


`bra`

Branch to a target and continue execution there.

Syntax

@p   bra{.uni}  tgt;           // tgt is a label
         bra{.uni}  tgt;           // unconditional branch

Description

Continue execution at the target. Conditional branches are specified by using a guard predicate. The branch target must be a label.

`bra.uni` is guaranteed to be non-divergent, i.e. all active threads in a warp that are currently executing this instruction have identical values for the guard predicate and branch target.

Semantics

if (p) {
        pc = tgt;
    }

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Unimplemented indirect branch introduced in PTX ISA version 2.1 has been removed from the spec.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

bra.uni  L_exit;    // uniform unconditional jump
    @q  bra      L23;   // conditional branch

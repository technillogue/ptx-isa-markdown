#### 9.7.1.15. Integer Arithmetic Instructions:clz


`clz`

Count leading zeros.

Syntax

clz.type  d, a;
    
    .type = { .b32, .b64 };

Description

Count the number of leading zeros in `a` starting with the most-significant bit and place the result in 32-bit destination register `d`. Operand `a` has the instruction type, and destination `d` has type `.u32`. For `.b32` type, the number of leading zeros is between 0 and 32, inclusively. For `.b64` type, the number of leading zeros is between 0 and 64, inclusively.

Semantics

.u32  d = 0;
    if (.type == .b32)   { max = 32; mask = 0x80000000; }
    else                 { max = 64; mask = 0x8000000000000000; }
    
    while (d < max && (a&mask == 0) ) {
        d++;
        a = a << 1;
    }

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

Target ISA Notes

`clz` requires `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

clz.b32  d, a;
    clz.b64  cnt, X;  // cnt is .u32

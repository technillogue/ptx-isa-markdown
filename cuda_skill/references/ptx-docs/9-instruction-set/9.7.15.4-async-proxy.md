#### 9.7.15.4. Async Proxy


The `wgmma.mma_async` operations are performed in the asynchronous proxy (or async proxy).

Accessing the same memory location across multiple proxies needs a cross-proxy fence. For the async proxy, `fence.proxy.async` should be used to synchronize memory between generic proxy and the async proxy.

The completion of a `wgmma.mma_async` operation is followed by an implicit generic-async proxy fence. So the result of the asynchronous operation is made visible to the generic proxy as soon as its completion is observed. `wgmma.commit_group` and `wgmma.wait_group` operations must be used to wait for the completion of the `wgmma.mma_async` instructions.

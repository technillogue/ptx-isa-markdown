#### 9.7.1.9. Integer Arithmetic Instructions:rem


`rem`

The remainder of integer division.

Syntax

rem.type  d, a, b;
    
    .type = { .u16, .u32, .u64,
              .s16, .s32, .s64 };

Description

Divides `a` by `b`, store the remainder in `d`.

Semantics

d = a % b;

Notes

The behavior for negative numbers is machine-dependent and depends on whether divide rounds towards zero or negative infinity.

Division by zero yields an unspecified, machine-specific value.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

rem.s32  x,x,8;    // x = x%8;

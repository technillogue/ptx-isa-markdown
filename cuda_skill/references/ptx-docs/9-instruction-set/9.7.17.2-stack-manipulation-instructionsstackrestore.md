#### 9.7.17.2. Stack Manipulation Instructions:stackrestore


`stackrestore`

Update the stack pointer with a new value.

Syntax

stackrestore.type  a;
    
    .type = { .u32, .u64 };

Description

Sets the current stack pointer to source register `a`.

When `stackrestore` is used with operand `a` written by a prior `stacksave` instruction, it will effectively restore the state of stack as it was before `stacksave` was executed. Note that if `stackrestore` is used with an arbitrary value of `a`, it may cause corruption of stack pointer. This implies that the correct use of this feature requires that `stackrestore.type a` is used after `stacksave.type a` without redefining the value of `a` between them.

Operand `a` has the same type as the instruction type.

Semantics

stackptr = a;

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.3.

Target ISA Notes

`stackrestore` requires `sm_52` or higher.

Examples

.reg .u32 ra;
    stacksave.u32 ra;
    // Code that may modify stack pointer
    ...
    stackrestore.u32 ra;

#### 9.7.13.11. Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions:activemask


`activemask`

Queries the active threads within a warp.

Syntax

activemask.b32 d;

Description

`activemask` queries predicated-on active threads from the executing warp and sets the destination `d` with 32-bit integer mask where bit position in the mask corresponds to the thread’s `laneid`.

Destination `d` is a 32-bit destination register.

An active thread will contribute 1 for its entry in the result and exited or inactive or predicated-off thread will contribute 0 for its entry in the result.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 6.2.

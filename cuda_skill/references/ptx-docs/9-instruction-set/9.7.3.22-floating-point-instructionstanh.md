#### 9.7.3.22. Floating Point Instructions:tanh


`tanh`

Find the hyperbolic tangent of a value (in radians)

Syntax

tanh.approx.f32 d, a;

Description

Take hyperbolic tangent value of `a`.

The operands `d` and `a` are of type `.f32`.

Semantics

d = tanh(a);

Notes

`tanh.approx.f32` implements a fast approximation to FP32 hyperbolic-tangent.

Results of `tanh` for various corner-case inputs are as follows:

Input | Result  
---|---  
-Inf | -1.0  
-0.0 | -0.0  
+0.0 | +0.0  
+Inf | 1.0  
NaN | NaN

The maximum relative error over the entire floating point range is 2-11. The subnormal numbers are supported.

Note  
  
The subnormal inputs gets passed through to the output since the value of `tanh(x)` for small values of `x` is approximately the same as `x`.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_75` or higher.

Examples

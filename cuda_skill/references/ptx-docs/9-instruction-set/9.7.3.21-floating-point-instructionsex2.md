#### 9.7.3.21. Floating Point Instructions:ex2


`ex2`

Find the base-2 exponential of a value.

Syntax

ex2.approx{.ftz}.f32  d, a;

Description

Raise 2 to the power `a`.

Semantics

d = 2 ^ a;

Notes

`ex2.approx.f32` implements a fast approximation to 2a.

Input | Result  
---|---  
-Inf | +0.0  
-0.0 | +1.0  
+0.0 | +1.0  
+Inf | +Inf  
NaN | NaN

The maximum ulp error is 2 ulp from correctly rounded result across the full range of inputs.

Subnormal numbers:

`sm_20+`  
    

By default, subnormal numbers are supported.

`ex2.ftz.f32` flushes subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

`sm_1x`
    

Subnormal inputs and results to sign-preserving zero.

PTX ISA Notes

`ex2.f32` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.0. Explicit modifiers `.approx` and `.ftz` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.4.

For PTX ISA version 1.4 and later, the `.approx` modifier is required.

For PTX ISA versions 1.0 through 1.3, `ex2.f32` defaults to `ex2.approx.ftz.f32`.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

ex2.approx.ftz.f32  xa, a;

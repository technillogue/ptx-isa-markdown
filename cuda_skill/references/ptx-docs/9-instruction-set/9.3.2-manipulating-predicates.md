### 9.3.2. Manipulating Predicates


Predicate values may be computed and manipulated using the following instructions: `and`, `or`, `xor`, `not`, and `mov`.

There is no direct conversion between predicates and integer values, and no direct way to load or store predicate register values. However, `setp` can be used to generate a predicate from an integer, and the predicate-based select (`selp`) instruction can be used to generate an integer value based on the value of a predicate; for example:

selp.u32 %r1,1,0,%p;    // convert predicate to 32-bit value

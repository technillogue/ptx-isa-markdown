## 7.3. Alloca


PTX provides `alloca` instruction for allocating storage at runtime on the per-thread local memory stack. The allocated stack memory can be accessed with `ld.local` and `st.local` instructions using the pointer returned by `alloca`.

In order to facilitate deallocation of memory allocated with `alloca`, PTX provides two additional instructions: `stacksave` which allows reading the value of stack pointer in a local variable, and `stackrestore` which can restore the stack pointer with the saved value.

`alloca`, `stacksave`, and `stackrestore` instructions are described in [Stack Manipulation Instructions](<#stack-manipulation-instructions>).

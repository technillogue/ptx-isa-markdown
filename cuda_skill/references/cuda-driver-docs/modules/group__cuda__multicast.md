### Functions

CUresult cuMulticastAddDevice ( CUmemGenericAllocationHandle mcHandle, CUdevice dev )


Associate a device to a multicast object.

######  Parameters

`mcHandle`
    Handle representing a multicast object.
`dev`
    Device that will be associated to the multicast object.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED

###### Description

Associates a device to a multicast object. The added device will be a part of the multicast team of size specified by CUmulticastObjectProp::numDevices during cuMulticastCreate. The association of the device to the multicast object is permanent during the life time of the multicast object. All devices must be added to the multicast team before any memory can be bound to any device in the team. Any calls to cuMulticastBindMem, cuMulticastBindMem_v2, cuMulticastBindAddr, or cuMulticastBindAddr_v2 will block until all devices have been added. Similarly all devices must be added to the multicast team before a virtual address range can be mapped to the multicast object. A call to cuMemMap will block until all devices have been added.

CUresult cuMulticastBindAddr ( CUmemGenericAllocationHandle mcHandle, size_t mcOffset, CUdeviceptr memptr, size_t size, unsigned long long flags )


Bind a memory allocation represented by a virtual address to a multicast object.

######  Parameters

`mcHandle`
    Handle representing a multicast object.
`mcOffset`
    Offset into multicast va range for attachment.
`memptr`
    Virtual address of the memory allocation.
`size`
    Size of memory that will be bound to the multicast object.
`flags`
    Flags for future use, must be zero now.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY, CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE

###### Description

Binds a memory allocation specified by its mapped address `memptr` to a multicast object represented by `mcHandle`. The memory must have been allocated via cuMemCreate or cudaMallocAsync. The intended `size` of the bind, the offset in the multicast range `mcOffset` and `memptr` must be a multiple of the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM. For best performance however, `size`, `mcOffset` and `memptr` should be aligned to the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_RECOMMENDED.

The `size` cannot be larger than the size of the allocated memory. Similarly the `size` \+ `mcOffset` cannot be larger than the total size of the multicast object. The memory allocation must have beeen created on one of the devices that was added to the multicast team via cuMulticastAddDevice. Externally shareable as well as imported multicast objects can be bound only to externally shareable memory. Note that this call will return CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there are insufficient resources required to perform the bind. This call may also return CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY if the necessary system software is not initialized or running.

This call may return CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE if the system configuration is in an illegal state. In such cases, to continue using multicast, verify that the system configuration is in a valid state and all required driver daemons are running properly.

CUresult cuMulticastBindAddr_v2 ( CUmemGenericAllocationHandle mcHandle, CUdevice dev, size_t mcOffset, CUdeviceptr memptr, size_t size, unsigned long long flags )


Bind a memory allocation represented by a virtual address to a multicast object.

######  Parameters

`mcHandle`
    Handle representing a multicast object.
`dev`
    The device that for which the multicast memory binding will be applicable.
`mcOffset`
    Offset into multicast va range for attachment.
`memptr`
    Virtual address of the memory allocation.
`size`
    Size of memory that will be bound to the multicast object.
`flags`
    Flags for future use, must be zero now.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY, CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE

###### Description

Binds a memory allocation specified by its mapped address `memptr` to a multicast object represented by `mcHandle`. The binding will be applicable for the device `dev`. The memory must have been allocated via cuMemCreate or cudaMallocAsync. The intended `size` of the bind, the offset in the multicast range `mcOffset` and `memptr` must be a multiple of the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM. For best performance however, `size`, `mcOffset` and `memptr` should be aligned to the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_RECOMMENDED.

The `size` cannot be larger than the size of the allocated memory. Similarly the `size` \+ `mcOffset` cannot be larger than the total size of the multicast object. For device memory, i.e., type CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE, the memory allocation must have been created on the device specified by `dev`. For host NUMA memory, i.e., type CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA, the memory allocation must have been created on the CPU NUMA node closest to `dev`. That is, the value returned when querying CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_NUMA_ID for `dev`, must be the CPU NUMA node where the memory was allocated. In both cases, the device named by `dev` must have been added to the multicast team via cuMulticastAddDevice. Externally shareable as well as imported multicast objects can be bound only to externally shareable memory. Note that this call will return CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there are insufficient resources required to perform the bind. This call may also return CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY if the necessary system software is not initialized or running.

This call may return CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE if the system configuration is in an illegal state. In such cases, to continue using multicast, verify that the system configuration is in a valid state and all required driver daemons are running properly.

    Offset into the multicast object for attachment.
`memHandle`
    Handle representing a memory allocation.
`memOffset`

The intended `size` of the bind, the offset in the multicast range `mcOffset` as well as the offset in the memory `memOffset` must be a multiple of the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM. For best performance however, `size`, `mcOffset` and `memOffset` should be aligned to the granularity of the memory allocation(see ::cuMemGetAllocationGranularity) or to the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_RECOMMENDED.

The `size` \+ `memOffset` cannot be larger than the size of the allocated memory. Similarly the `size` \+ `mcOffset` cannot be larger than the size of the multicast object. The memory allocation must have beeen created on one of the devices that was added to the multicast team via cuMulticastAddDevice.

###### Description

Binds a memory allocation specified by `memHandle` and created via cuMemCreate to a multicast object represented by `mcHandle` and created via cuMulticastCreate. The binding will be applicable for the device `dev`. The intended `size` of the bind, the offset in the multicast range `mcOffset` as well as the offset in the memory `memOffset` must be a multiple of the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM. For best performance however, `size`, `mcOffset` and `memOffset` should be aligned to the granularity of the memory allocation(see ::cuMemGetAllocationGranularity) or to the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_RECOMMENDED.

The `size` \+ `memOffset` cannot be larger than the size of the allocated memory. Similarly the `size` \+ `mcOffset` cannot be larger than the size of the multicast object. The memory allocation must have beeen created on one of the devices that was added to the multicast team via cuMulticastAddDevice. For device memory, i.e., type CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_DEVICE, the memory allocation must have been created on the device specified by `dev`. For host NUMA memory, i.e., type CU_MEM_LOCATION_TYPE_HOST_NUMA, the memory allocation must have been created on the CPU NUMA node closest to `dev`. That is, the value returned when querying CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_HOST_NUMA_ID for `dev`, must be the CPU NUMA node where the memory was allocated. In both cases, the device named by `dev` must have been added to the multicast team via cuMulticastAddDevice. Externally shareable as well as imported multicast objects can be bound only to externally shareable memory. Note that this call will return CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there are insufficient resources required to perform the bind. This call may also return CUDA_ERROR_SYSTEM_NOT_READY if the necessary system software is not initialized or running.

This call may return CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_STATE if the system configuration is in an illegal state. In such cases, to continue using multicast, verify that the system configuration is in a valid state and all required driver daemons are running properly.

CUresult cuMulticastCreate ( CUmemGenericAllocationHandle* mcHandle, const CUmulticastObjectProp* prop )


Create a generic allocation handle representing a multicast object described by the given properties.

######  Parameters

`mcHandle`
    Value of handle returned.
`prop`
    Properties of the multicast object to create.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED

###### Description

This creates a multicast object as described by `prop`. The number of participating devices is specified by CUmulticastObjectProp::numDevices. Devices can be added to the multicast object via cuMulticastAddDevice. All participating devices must be added to the multicast object before memory can be bound to it. Memory is bound to the multicast object via cuMulticastBindMem, cuMulticastBindMem_v2, cuMulticastBindAddr, or cuMulticastBindAddr_v2. and can be unbound via cuMulticastUnbind. The total amount of memory that can be bound per device is specified by :CUmulticastObjectProp::size. This size must be a multiple of the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM. For best performance however, the size should be aligned to the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity with the flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_RECOMMENDED.

After all participating devices have been added, multicast objects can also be mapped to a device's virtual address space using the virtual memory management APIs (see cuMemMap and cuMemSetAccess). Multicast objects can also be shared with other processes by requesting a shareable handle via cuMemExportToShareableHandle. Note that the desired types of shareable handles must be specified in the bitmask CUmulticastObjectProp::handleTypes. Multicast objects can be released using the virtual memory management API cuMemRelease.

CUresult cuMulticastGetGranularity ( size_t* granularity, const CUmulticastObjectProp* prop, CUmulticastGranularity_flags option )


Calculates either the minimal or recommended granularity for multicast object.

######  Parameters

`granularity`
    Returned granularity.
`prop`
    Properties of the multicast object.
`option`
    Determines which granularity to return.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED

###### Description

Calculates either the minimal or recommended granularity for a given set of multicast object properties and returns it in granularity. This granularity can be used as a multiple for size, bind offsets and address mappings of the multicast object.

CUresult cuMulticastUnbind ( CUmemGenericAllocationHandle mcHandle, CUdevice dev, size_t mcOffset, size_t size )


Unbind any memory allocations bound to a multicast object at a given offset and upto a given size.

######  Parameters

`mcHandle`
    Handle representing a multicast object.
`dev`
    Device that hosts the memory allocation.
`mcOffset`
    Offset into the multicast object.
`size`
    Desired size to unbind.

###### Returns

CUDA_SUCCESS, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE, CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_DEVICE, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_DEINITIALIZED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED, CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED

###### Description

Unbinds any memory allocations hosted on `dev` and bound to a multicast object at `mcOffset` and upto a given `size`. The intended `size` of the unbind and the offset in the multicast range ( `mcOffset` ) must be a multiple of the value returned by cuMulticastGetGranularity flag CU_MULTICAST_GRANULARITY_MINIMUM. The `size` \+ `mcOffset` cannot be larger than the total size of the multicast object.

Warning: The `mcOffset` and the `size` must match the corresponding values specified during the bind call. Any other values may result in undefined behavior.
